# Appendix: Brag Document Template

Here’s a template for a brag document! Usually, I make one brag document per year (e.g., *"Julia’s 2017 Brag Document"*). I think it’s okay to make it quite long and comprehensive—5-10 pages or more for a year of work doesn’t seem excessive, especially if you include graphs, charts, or screenshots to show the effects of your contributions.

One thing I want to emphasize, for people who don’t like to brag, is—you don’t have to try to make your work sound better than it is. Just make it sound *exactly* as good as it is! For example:  

> *"Was the primary contributor to X new feature that’s now used by 60% of our customers and has gotten Y positive feedback."*

## Goals for This Year  
List your major goals here! Sharing your goals with your manager & coworkers is really helpful because it allows them to support you in achieving them.

## Goals for Next Year  
If it’s getting towards the end of the year, start noting down what you think your goals for next year might be.

## Projects  
For each project, go through:

- **Your contributions**:  
  - Did you come up with the design?  
  - Which components did you build?  
  - Did you identify a useful insight like *"Wait, we can cut scope and achieve the same goal with far less work"*?  

- **Impact of the project**:  
  - Who was it for?  
  - Are there measurable outcomes? (e.g., saved X dollars, shipped a new feature that helped sell Y big deals, improved performance by X%, used by X internal users daily).  
  - Did it support an important non-numeric company goal? (e.g., required for an audit, helped retain an important user).  

Remember: *Don’t forget to explain what the actual results of your work were!* It’s often useful to go back a few months later and update the impact after launch.

## Collaboration & Mentorship  
Examples of things to include:

- Helping others in an area of expertise (e.g., *"Other engineers regularly ask me for one-off help solving weird bugs in their CSS."*)  
- Mentoring interns or helping new team members onboard  
- Writing clear emails, meeting notes, or documentation  
- Foundational code that others build upon  
- Improving monitoring, dashboards, or on-call processes  
- Meaningful code reviews  
- Answering important questions for teammates (e.g., *"Helped Risha from OTHER_TEAM with a lot of questions related to Y."*)  
- Mentoring someone on a project (e.g., *"Gave Ben advice on leading his first big project."*)  
- Giving an internal talk or workshop  

---

## Design & Documentation  
List design docs and documentation you worked on.

- **Design Docs**: Mention if you wrote or reviewed a design for a project.  
- **Documentation**: Briefly explain the goal behind the documentation (e.g., *"We were getting a lot of questions about X, so I documented it to improve response time."*).  

---

## Company Building  
This section includes things you did to help the company overall, beyond your specific team or project. Examples:

- Going above & beyond with **interviewing or recruiting** (e.g., campus recruiting, improving the interview process).  
- Improving important **internal processes** (e.g., writing better onboarding materials).  

---

## What You Learned  
This is a great way to reflect on your growth. List key things you’ve learned or skills you’ve developed. Some ideas:

- Performance analysis & optimizing code  
- Internals of key software (e.g., JVM, Postgres, Linux)  
- Mastering a library (e.g., React)  
- Learning an important tool (e.g., CLI, Firefox DevTools)  
- Deepening knowledge in an area like **localization, timezones, UX design, or product management**  
- Writing clear design documents  
- Learning a new programming language  

It’s easy to overlook your progress, so taking a moment to document it can be really motivating.

---

## Outside of Work  
Tracking accomplishments outside of work can be valuable too:

- **Blog posts, talks, or panels**  
- **Open-source contributions**  
- **Industry recognition**  

You can also include **non-career achievements** that you're proud of, if that feels meaningful to you. Some people like to maintain a combined personal + work brag document.

---

## General Prompts  
If you're struggling to think of things to include, try asking yourself:

- If you were convincing a friend to join your team, what would you highlight about your work?  
- Has anyone given you positive feedback recently?

This template is meant to be flexible—adapt it in a way that works best for you!
